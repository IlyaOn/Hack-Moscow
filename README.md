# Hack-Moscow

A project created as part of the first Hack Moscow hackathon.

# Description

This is a VR app based on the UE4 engine. The app is a math class simulator. The user appears in the room with a blackboard and a crayon in his hand. The user writes a function from two or three variables on the Board, and then an interactive graph or surface of this function will appear in the room. Also, the main indicators of this point will appear on the Board: derivative, primitive, extreme points, and so on.
